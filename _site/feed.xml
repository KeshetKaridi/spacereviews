<p>Grapefruits: no fruit truly encapsulates the ups and downs of life like the grapefruit.</p>

<p>Fun memories of the grapefruit include sitting on the stoep at my Oupa’s house in my home town of Swellendam. Getting through the grapefruit peel is a task unto itself; getting through it while maintaining the integrity of the segment is an even more significant task.</p>

<p>Each new grapefruit I consumed over my stay, I became more meticulous and effective at unwrapping the precious fruit inside. Once one has made their way through the challenging exterior to reveal the juicy gem, they are greeted with a bittersweet reward.</p>

<p>The grapefruit reflects the truth of life itself. Throughout the ceaseless toil of life, we are rewarded with sweet victory as well as bitter challenges. In learning to appreciate the bitter pith that encases the sweet sap, we can learn to live life to the fullest.</p>]]></content><author><name>keshet</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Life and Grapefruits]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kiwifruit</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/08/22/kiwifruit.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kiwifruit" /><published>2018-08-22T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-08-22T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/08/22/kiwifruit</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/08/22/kiwifruit.html"><![CDATA[<p>Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the
